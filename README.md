# microservices-template

This is a template to quickly get started with microservices. This template sets up a basic project skeleton and uses...

- Spring Boot for the 'api'
- Angular for the front-end, which is deployed with the proxy
- Jhipster UAA (Oauth2, JWT)
- JHipster Registry for services
- MongoDB
- Hazelcast
- Sonar
- Bootstrap
- Elasticstack
- Docker (in the docker-compose folder)
- Cucumber
- Protractor
- Maven for a build tool
- International support (English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean)
